# Introduction
This topic is my practices on the Learning path of Udacity

The source dataset is taken from Seattle Airbnb and Boston Airbnb

According to the requirement "pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used" of Udacity, I had figured out 5 questions in this topic

1) Try to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas/ cities.

2) Examine the Total_price by top20 listing_id at each city and its reservation days.

3) Try to understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price, based on the 2 datasets: boston_listings and seattle_listings.

4) Can you find negative and positive reviews based on text?

5) Make 2 time-series model to forecasting the difference of the reservation_prices between 2 cities.

Follow that, we can understand the difference between 2 cities by looking at these question, doing EDA and also comparing the Machine Learning models. Moreover, these 5 questions is applied many problems:

Time-series forecasting in Question 5

Regression in Question 3

Ngrams-analytics (a part of NLP) in Question 4.

Now, we must import the necessary libraries then load our dataset
